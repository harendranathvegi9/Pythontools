Pythontools
===========

Simple Tools in Python which can be of use


The bench mark test script will check how much time is taken for a 
Python Script to run from start to end. Telling its performance in hours mins and secs.
The tool can take in two types of input.
1. Get scripts from a file
2. Get the script from command line.

The tool supports multiple scripts to be run through file.
Commandline run supports only single script to be run.

The tool is still under Test

Enhancements (TBD):
------------
1. Implement KeyboardInterrupt handling properly
2. Commandline execution. Support multiple scripts in commandline
3. More Proper Error handling
4. Use argparse for handling commandline arguements.
